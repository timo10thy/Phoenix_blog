          <P class="opacity-80 word-wrap w-3/4">Home to over ten million people(and much more in the metro region), Bankok has endless sights, it's street life, meseums, temples and skyline definitely mean you can spend countless hours exploring looking for photos. On the other hand, its insane trafic diagnosed urban planning(it lack of proper zoning until recently) and hot humid wheather. Neverther the less,below are some of my favourites

            <p class="px-10 py-2"><span class="font-bold">What I love about it:</span> Our newest entry to the list is this incredibly designed travel blog,   The Flore, written by Florian Kriechbaumer—an awesome, multi-talented man who is currently traveling the world and documenting all of his experiences on his blog. I love his use of bold typography, which strikes the perfect balance between identity and content. It's not the easiest thing to achieve, for sure.

                All of his stories are meticulously documented with incredible photography, excellent storytelling, and additional media such as maps, setting this website apart from the others on this list.

                A great example of this is found in his blog entry, A First Glimpse of Thailand—an incredibly well-documented travel story about none other than my little home city, Bangkok. As you scroll through the page, it feels like flipping through a travel magazine, with stunning photos accompanied by easily digestible stories. The Flore definitely stands out from the rest of the websites on this list.
